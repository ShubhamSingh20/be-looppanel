Speaker A (00:00:00 -- 00:00:45):
It because there is a way. You started with tailwind, but then there was a crash in 92, it went up. We earned 30 crores, but there was a crash and all kinds of guys got wiped out. The guys with thousands of crores, they got wiped out. So you have to save yourself and you have to still come to the office and do your stuff. What happens is that if you're not passionate about it, you don't want to do that. You came for the good time and it turn out to a boss. What is this? It is a bad time. So in bad time you don't feel like coming to the office. That is not the case with us. I come to office without I don't care a damn whether market is down 2% up it is. I'm as excited I was excited about today's, this meeting and all. So what is important is to be super passionate in bad time.

Speaker B (00:01:00 -- 00:01:48):
Welcome to the Bloom podcast featuring Mr. Ramde Agarwal, chairman and co founder of Motilal Oswal Financial Services, one of India's leading financial services firms. A first generation entrepreneur, mr. Agarwal cofounded Motilal Oswal in 1987 at a time when India was still under the license Raj. Since then, he has grown the company to one of the most respected names in India's financial services industry. Through the years, he's had a front row seat to the evolution of financial markets and the industry in India played a leading role in shaping the financial services industry. He's known for his astute investment philosophy, which has helped him identify some of India's most successful companies well before they became household names. His philosophy of investment remains long term and seeing returns compounded. And that's why we love to have him as a guest on our show. Welcome to the show Mr. Agarwal.

Speaker A (00:01:49 -- 00:01:50):
My pleasure to be here.

Speaker B (00:01:50 -- 00:02:20):
So thank you again. I love meeting you the first time and thanks for this opportunity. And as we discussed, we'll break this into three sections for our listeners today. We would love to hear parts of the Motilal story itself because as you've rightly said, it's a startup in its own destiny from the then you know, I think it's a tough time in India as much as there is optimism. There's a little bit of skepticism in the startup world today. Valuations have come to a halt, capitalists.

Speaker A (00:02:20 -- 00:02:21):
Come to a pause.

Speaker B (00:02:22 -- 00:02:41):
So would love to instill a little bit of optimism on where we think India is going over the next 25 years. And as I might have mentioned to you, our theme for this year's storytell to our audiences is the power of compounding. And who better to ask have those answers from than you? So shall we get started?

Speaker A (00:02:41 -- 00:02:44):
So at Bloom we continue to think.

Speaker B (00:02:44 -- 00:03:07):
Of find these really early stage startups and we try to figure out what is the dynamic between the co founders and to see whether Yashadi Yirishta will continue. How are we simply backing two people who've come together for convenience? And you started Motilal Oswald with Mr. Motilal Oswal.

Speaker A (00:03:07 -- 00:03:07):
Right.

Speaker B (00:03:07 -- 00:03:20):
You decided to name the firm after him. So it'll be great to know. How did that meeting happen? It's often been told in the markets. And how were you different from each other? How were you complementing each other? What made you be great co founders?

Speaker A (00:03:21 -- 00:04:36):
It's really like going back to 87, 80. So let me give my background a little bit so that will connect better. So I'm actually farmer's son from Chattisgar. Rapur shattisgar. Okay. We still till land at home. Oh, yeah. So proper farming kind of family. And so you can imagine how much stock market knowledge would be there. And that in Raipur. I grew up in a village where there was no electricity, no Paka road. So aman it was proper Indian village. What you see in 60s or seventy s of Indian movies. I came to Raipur for formal education after fifth and then I came to Nagpur to do become an English medium. Then the steep journey started and then came to I barely passed become in English medium. I was very good in accounts. Came to Mumbai to do CA. It was again a painful journey because I failed four times in intermediate. A lot of learnings happened while doing CA. Four times I failed. And the reason I failed was my handwriting was bad, very bad. So I was not able to read what I have written. So I changed my handwriting. I went to pre Kg kind of thing. Zero slant, full stop, those stuff.

Speaker B (00:04:36 -- 00:04:38):
It's an amazing story.

Speaker A (00:04:38 -- 00:04:51):
I did the age of 24 and then I had beautiful handwriting. Again, I failed because I couldn't complete the paper with beautiful handwriting. There was no speed. So next time I six months I did speed writing with the good handwriting and then no looking back.

Speaker B (00:04:51 -- 00:04:52):
Amazing.

Speaker A (00:04:52 -- 00:05:55):
Even intermediate final. Everything just went through smooth and that gave me a lot of confidence. I became CA in 83. By that time I had fallen in love with stock market in Mumbai by doing audits of century textile, premium, automobile, all sorts of companies listed. And I was a good reader. One of the things I'll tell you is a reading habit from even Rapport stage. I was voracious reader of fiction. And when I came to Mumbai, the circulation library was there. So I used to read lot of high finance fiction. High finance in fiction itself. Like billion dollar Show thing in 80s, silver Bear, Money changers. So those kind of stuff I started reading and that started shaping my mind. I didn't know where was America, what it meant, but those large things away from my own economic reality, which is understood. So that's how I completed my CA. And then I said now real time has come to figure out when you do CA you get to see huge numbers in the companies which you audit. Banks you audit.

Speaker B (00:05:55 -- 00:05:55):
That's correct.

Speaker A (00:05:55 -- 00:06:27):
So again, unreal. But that's what we did. Yes. Then you come real life again. You are back to pavilion. This is that. There is nothing in pocket and huge dreams. You want to make life in Mumbai, make a success. So then I said, stock market is only way I can make it. But I didn't know from where to start. I had no clue. And I was doing research. I was boricious, read up balance sheet. One opening happened for one. Equity research was not that common as it is today. That's right. So I was the only applicant. I went with my own collection of 200 balance sheets to that job.

Speaker B (00:06:28 -- 00:06:28):
Oh wow.

Speaker A (00:06:28 -- 00:08:51):
Okay. $3,000 per month. I worked for two years, wrote a book and I used to work ten to 12 hours. That was the biggest learning point. And then I met Moti. So it so happened that I was living in Lokanwala. Complex was just coming up. It was a brand new outfit and roads were not proper. Communication was not proper. So finding local sorry. That connect between the Andhari station. And that was difficult. So I had a bike. So I started giving him ride from their free ride. Okay. He's very quick. So I used to be late always. So then he started coming to my home. And then we started going together. And then I started talking. And then I realized that he's also interested in stock market. And he's a brilliant chart and three, four years younger than me but much more brilliant chart accountant. So then we said, let's come together and start this Motilaro swall that time the name was Prudential Portfolio Services at the beginning. Okay. And the real insight was that I was knowing everything was stock market. But I had not a penny in my pocket. And how do we make a business out of it? Because anything multiplied by zero is zero. So all the knowledge but zero multiplied zero. So I said, first get hold of some money. And the only way possible was broking. Because broking was an acute shortage at that point of time. Understood? So we decided that it's a seller's market. So let's get in with no two bosses. One, Pune. And we started. And so no capital also no capital. Because since his brother was in a stock market in Ahmedabad, they used to buy there in a spot market and sell it in T 15. T plus 15 in Mumbai. So they used to make three 4% spread. We were not interested in their spread. We were interested in our 75 bips brokerage. And that's how the thing started. I think our real godfather is Moti's brother, Jevaribai. So that's how it started. First year, maybe we must have made two late two, three legs brokerage. Then 4510. In first five years, we collected about 15 legs. Post tax money, we always paid full taxes in 20 in 1990 we bought the membership, BSE membership, 25 legs. Again, we were back to zero. We had no net worth when we opened the doors and then Hashem met the bulldog and started market went up six X from 700 to 4200 in 19 months flat. We made 30 crores. No speculation. And that was the starting of mother.

Speaker B (00:08:51 -- 00:09:23):
Fantastic story. No? Fantastic. We can go on for hours just on the story, but thank you for sharing everything so honestly. This is the beauty of having a nice heart to heart podcast. So when Motilal Oswald started in 87, I mean, you couldn't even imagine that there'll be economic liberalization Ashad meta, the kind of growth that we saw for the next 1520 years, suddenly you'd land up in 2008 or ten. You couldn't have imagined, for example, the startup boom would happen. People were very skeptical when we started Bloom in 2012.

Speaker A (00:09:23 -- 00:09:25):
Now you've looked at this from a.

Speaker B (00:09:25 -- 00:09:48):
35 year lens, from what little you see of founders and people you meet compared to when you started and what those backgrounds that you came from. What do you sense today in the younger entrepreneurs? What do you think has changed in terms of ambition? How are they wired? Are they doing all the right things or thinking about it the right way? Any impressions?

Speaker A (00:09:48 -- 00:10:07):
It's a different world altogether. In fact, I tried to fund one or two of them without much success. So one of the thing is that this culture of making losses and the loss funding of the initial four or five years or maybe forever, you never know. So this was not the game. There was nobody to fund you losses.

Speaker B (00:10:07 -- 00:10:08):
That's right.

Speaker A (00:10:08 -- 00:10:35):
There would be somebody to give me 510 crores, family, friends, to working capital. Working not working capital or fixed capital, whatever, business capital business. And they would expect that right from day one. Business so strong that you make thin money, but you make some money. There's no negative spiral later on, once you start and then it goes spiral, you die out. That's a different thing. But to start with, you don't make a business model with the losses. I mean, that was not the culture in 87. That's right.

Speaker B (00:10:35 -- 00:10:36):
There's no venture capitalism.

Speaker A (00:10:36 -- 00:11:14):
Yeah, there was no venture capital kind of thing. So I think the venture capitalism was happening through Canbank SBI. They used to give some there was no collateral, but they would give 50 lakhs, 20 lakhs. They will also try to find some debtors as a collateral, some receivable size of collateral or something like that. But they would expect the companies to make money. That was a culture of a startup which was very small in eighty s. Ninety s and also, I think this Facebook and all this digital companies, this post in this century, I mean, this all came from us in the sense that correct. The startup culture was always there in us.

Speaker B (00:11:14 -- 00:11:15):
That's right.

Speaker A (00:11:15 -- 00:12:07):
But startup with a strong loss machine to start with, because it's not that it's a bad thing, but just the accounting is different. Yes. There's no balance sheet item, it's all PNL. Whatever you do, customer equation and all that all gets debited in the PNL. Otherwise, if you set up a paper plant, you take set up a steel plant, the whole capital cost goes in the balance sheet. That's correct. Your PNL remains thin and looks nice, whereas here everything is just stuffed into P L. So I think accounting standards needs to change with this. They have not actually moved forward. They have to find some way of changing with the change of time. The accounting should have progressed, but it has not changed. And that's a confusion. We all come from the old mindset because accounting standards declare whatever they declare. So there's a lot of confusion.

Speaker B (00:12:07 -- 00:12:36):
So two quick points. I think initially when venture was started in the US, it was to fundamentally fund commercialization of cutting edge technology like semiconductors and personal computers, which people, if a model didn't exist, you're taking high risk whether it ever get adopted. So there's no question of making profits in the short term. And that somebody had to fund and an industry slowly got built and the confidence kept growing. What has happened is, because technology becomes so pervasive, every business looks like it.

Speaker A (00:12:36 -- 00:12:38):
Can be engineered faster.

Speaker B (00:12:39 -- 00:12:57):
Shampoo BANATHE, now they say d, two C, shampoo brand can grow ten times faster. There's no basis for it. So what's happened is the risk taking appetite has increased and artificially has bloated those losses. Now the question is, are we accountable for eventually converting them to profitability? Yes. Even if Facebook turned profitable before going.

Speaker A (00:12:57 -- 00:14:29):
Public, I think it is the stock market which despiled them. What you said is right to bring the high tech into the action. They funded it with a laudable objective because the risk levels are very high, mortality was very high, but more recently it was the greed of the stock market. When the Facebook and all these bigger ones, they started flying more probably post 2008 when they started recovering and internet actually became pervasive with it coming on the phones, it just opened up. I mean, you had 6 billion consumers correct. With a hand. Correct. And that changed a lot of things. Some of the things were right things and some of the particular stock market, what they did, that was absolutely wrong. And everybody wants to have a startup in their portfolio which might be mini Facebook. So I think every bad thing starts with something good. And that's what really happened. It started with a good idea of funding losses for aspirational technology or completely new ideas. That's right. But now actually old ideas are also funded with the losses. The kids started coming into this fold, startup fold, to harness valuation rather than driven by semiconductor, or they want to bring new technology. This thing like mother. Also, we didn't start for valuation, we started to make few lakhs rupees so that we can justify to our parents that I'm not doing a job, but I can earn more than that. That was the whole idea. We never thought that we'll ever get listed.

Speaker B (00:14:29 -- 00:14:34):
So, two related questions, quick answers. One is therefore what advice to young founders?

Speaker A (00:14:34 -- 00:14:34):
Right?

Speaker B (00:14:35 -- 00:14:41):
There are lots listening to this. There are lots who want to start, want to do it for the right reasons, but they swayed by the market.

Speaker A (00:14:41 -- 00:15:13):
Maya no, but the word you used is right reasons. Right reason can never be for the valuations. Eventually it may lead to economic prosperity and valuation, but you have to driven by that concept, whatever be the purpose, whatever be the problem statement or whatever, I was mad after a stock market, I would have been a clerk, whatever, but I would have been in stock market. So that kind of drive so like, if you look at even Facebook, whatever, that movies and all, they were nuts, what they were doing.

Speaker B (00:15:13 -- 00:15:13):
Absolutely.

Speaker A (00:15:13 -- 00:15:18):
I don't think they were aware that they'll hit billions and trillions. No, that was not the idea. Correct.

Speaker B (00:15:19 -- 00:15:20):
It can't be the motivation.

Speaker A (00:15:20 -- 00:15:25):
Yeah. So that motivation, the drive, the passion, the purpose should drive you.

Speaker B (00:15:25 -- 00:16:21):
And so the sort of related question is do you think after having gone through that passion, so which I'm already jumping two levels ahead, but we'll go there later. But specifically, with your story, you've achieved that initial objective. Pelle dasal hoge. It's been a certain baseline has been achieved, which is where I find a lot of our founders are at. They did exactly what you said. They did it for the right reasons. They were super passionate about solving a problem. They've gotten to become CEOs, which they didn't know what it meant. So solo do, solo pan, soloko hire Kalia, then does core competence, is that the only way to create compounding of value after that, or for both yourself and for all stakeholders? And does that give you the most joy? Or do you start saying naima Yebi karunga wobi karunga and chase the next shiny thing out there?

Speaker A (00:16:21 -- 00:17:14):
See, what happens is entrepreneurship is not a straight line. Today there is tailwinded, tomorrow will be headwinded. The real thing is like a chuck of you. You can get in because there is a we started with a tailwind, but then there was a crash in 92. It went up. We earned 30 crores, but there was a crash and all kinds of guys got wiped out. Correct. The guys with thousands of crores, they got wiped out. Correct. So you have to save yourself and you have to still come to the office and do your stuff. What happens is that if you're not passionate about it, you don't want to do that. You came for the good time and it turned out to a boss. What is this? It is a bad time. In bad time, you don't feel like coming to the office. That is not the case with us. I come to office without I don't care a damn whether market is down 2% up. It is. I'm as excited I was excited about today's, this meeting and all. So what is important is to be super passionate in bad time.

Speaker B (00:17:14 -- 00:17:16):
That's the only way you overcome.

Speaker A (00:17:16 -- 00:17:28):
The compounding has that thing. The continuity is important. Compounding happens only with the passage of time. 20 years, 30 years, 40 years. Buffett is 65 years. You listen to his AGM, he's 92.

Speaker B (00:17:28 -- 00:17:29):
And he's like 92.

Speaker A (00:17:29 -- 00:17:48):
And his passion, you see, and his details of his own result and his own, the kind of $120,000,000,000, $150,000,000,000 my guns are loaded with, I'm looking for elephants at the age of 92. So that is called passion. What I'm saying is that the continuity of the passion is the entrepreneurship. Fantastic.

Speaker B (00:17:48 -- 00:18:24):
It's a nice crossover question, Mr. Agarwal, to move to what we think of the learnings from somebody you respect a lot, mr. Buffett. And I'm glad you brought up that point. This crazy passion of a 90 plus year old person for everything, not only in investing, but everything he's invested in, whether he eats his Coke and burger every day or whatever it may be. You talked about one crazy sort of feature of Mr. Buffett, right? Just being passionate about investing. Is there any other lessons that we can learn as Indian founders from you.

Speaker A (00:18:24 -- 00:19:07):
Read anything, but I would recommend for founders, yeah, two pages of his annual report of 2007, page six and seven. Great. Good gruesome. It is a must read. And not once. I know you guys are educated in English, but you must read at least ten times. Every time you'll be more educated. I can tell you this. He has said what he likes, what they want to buy between him and manja. So the first line is we buy what we understand. Now, this is investing, okay? And then next is good economics of the business. Second is run by passionate and good management. And third is a reasonable price. So two, three, four is like known to the world. But the real key, 90% is the first one.

Speaker B (00:19:07 -- 00:19:09):
You buy what you understand, what you understand.

Speaker A (00:19:09 -- 00:19:22):
If you don't understand something, how the hell you'll say that his business economics in next 20 years will be good? Is the management good? And if you don't understand this second and third, you can't price it. Is it gold or silver?

Speaker B (00:19:22 -- 00:19:23):
That's right.

Speaker A (00:19:23 -- 00:20:25):
How do you price it? That's right. So understanding is a key. And it is not only about investing every walk of life. That is true. You must understand. And you get confused. I mean, you are entrepreneur and you keep scaling up. As you're successful, you start getting bigger and bigger things, more complicated things. And you are in a situation where nobody can help you decide whether you want to hire this guy? Don't hire. Do you want to branch out here? Do you want to write 1000 crore check? Do you want a 10,000 crore check? Do you want to take this leverage risk? So whenever this kind of situation comes in entrepreneurship, every day the situation comes of course, small or big. That's right. That's what you founder for. My thing is always I'll keep asking till I understand, or if Muthi understands, let Muti take the decision or somebody else understand. Let him take the responsibility and take the decision. Because everybody's competence is different, but don't move till you understand. That is most important. So this is what I found in Buffett's sayings, interestingly.

Speaker B (00:20:25 -- 00:20:33):
Did this become I had a question on this. And so right time to ask this. Did this become the foundation for your QGLP framework, which you talk about?

Speaker A (00:20:33 -- 00:20:35):
QGLP is nothing but this only this.

Speaker B (00:20:35 -- 00:20:36):
Four line seems like exactly.

Speaker A (00:20:37 -- 00:20:54):
Growth is part of their quality, which we have kind of a split. So Q is quality of business, quality of management. G is for growth and L for longevity. So GNL, I think it's more silent in theirs, but they practice it and then the price is there just for.

Speaker B (00:20:54 -- 00:21:26):
Given that not everyone is investors, I think we apply, as you said, any good investor should apply a variant of this. You can't be driven by FOMO and New hot trend and Fads and et cetera. And that's a challenge in venture capital too. Everything looks very interesting because it's new and novel. But as you said, unless you get depth of understanding, how do you know this is going to be a ten year, 20 year business? But to simplify this, do you have a simplistic way of giving an example of what fit this framework very well when you picked it as an investing opportunity? Like any company, any founder.

Speaker A (00:21:26 -- 00:23:00):
So one other thing I learned from Buffett, if you see what the guidelines they have, there's some norms, they have some 20 norms or something. So in that, one of the thing is the kind of companies they look at it is that the company is making at least $10 million profit delivered. See, because he says that, I don't know if I go to Harvard in this class of 100 or 200, I can't figure out who is going to make it. Yeah, I mean, whom should I bet? Who is going to be the best? So, like that in businesses, there are multiple businesses. Mortality rate in the first ten years is almost like 90, 95%. That's correct. Okay, so you don't know. I mean, every kid looks very smart, every business model looks fantastic, but which will scale, which will be successful? You don't know. But when you look at $10 million profit means this guy has already made that profit. So mortality rate beyond that is going to be much lower, maybe 10%, 20%, but not 50, 60, 70%, his understanding starts happening after that. Otherwise he doesn't want to apply his mind only he doesn't want to buy into promotional companies. One of the thing about startups, which I learned I was doing, one of the wealth creation studies, is that it is investing in unknown and unknowable. There is a paper written by Harvard professor investing in unknown and unknowable. Neither the seller knows what is going to the future nor the buyer knows what is the future. And yet you are putting a value when you say that this venture is today capitalized at $100 million. Yes, I'm buying by putting $10 million, I'm buying 10%. So $100 million is capitalized. But the buyer and seller both have no clue. That's right.

Speaker B (00:23:00 -- 00:23:02):
Most of our life is that yeah.

Speaker A (00:23:02 -- 00:23:08):
So the way you win in that game is that by knowing his business better than him. Correct.

Speaker B (00:23:08 -- 00:23:23):
It's a very valid point because we emphasize to each one of our colleagues, do you have a market view that is stronger than that of the founder for you to be making this bet in the first place? What does a first time young founder know of the end state of this business? They don't know.

Speaker A (00:23:23 -- 00:23:34):
If you see the venture companies in US, they are typically very specialized in a very thin genre. That's right. They'll say we are in semiconductors, we are in medical field, we are in this field, we are BFSI.

Speaker B (00:23:34 -- 00:23:35):
It's beginning to happen finally here, sir.

Speaker A (00:23:36 -- 00:24:08):
That is what is happening. They are very specialized. You have to be in that sense because they are meeting hundreds and thousands of business models and they have seen a lot of success and failures. They are grey haired, they have connects here and there. They can call up in lab, they can call up God knows their network very well. The kid is coming from the school. He has one thin knowledge and lot of excitement. So passion correct. Looking into his eyes. But then if by chance he's sitting actually in the gold mine yeah. The other side should be able to get a sense of it.

Speaker B (00:24:08 -- 00:24:16):
It's true. I think great stories get built on that intuition and that market knowledge and that's what the VC keeps honing in his own.

Speaker A (00:24:16 -- 00:24:19):
And that's why they keep doing meetings after meetings, after meetings.

Speaker B (00:24:19 -- 00:24:22):
We tell we have to do the meetings four or five a week. Otherwise you can't educate yourself.

Speaker A (00:24:22 -- 00:24:40):
And then after sitting okay, liberally. Because they have a lot of money so they can give, say, $5 million. You start show me the prototype and then you go to the market. Let's see whether the customers like it. Then they'll buy the option. I'll put second round. If this happens, then I'll put this more money. He'll keep increasing his bet.

Speaker B (00:24:40 -- 00:25:01):
So one interesting question which founders are faced with all the time, this vision of how do you build a long term sustainable company and face short term pressures? We are also guilty as VCs we want quicker results hyper growth as you said we'll fund the losses but you grow fast have you ever faced that as an entrepreneur at Motilal and how do you contend with it?

Speaker A (00:25:01 -- 00:25:04):
We were not funded by anybody. We were self funded, so we had no pressure.

Speaker B (00:25:05 -- 00:25:10):
Even when you went public, you didn't care about there is always balanced, is what you're saying.

Speaker A (00:25:10 -- 00:25:26):
We never bothered with the stock price. Even today I don't know what is the stock price because I know I have nothing to do with the stock price. I have to deliver what we are good at. Not the stock price, but the net worth or earnings and earnings growth and Roe and those kind of stuff. I'm a business way to deliver.

Speaker B (00:25:26 -- 00:25:43):
Is there another company that you respect who's done this very well balanced like this? Good growth, not crazy growth but also thought about how do I build a 30 year organization? So there are many in the market but as you grew up from your generation, have you seen companies of that?

Speaker A (00:25:43 -- 00:26:27):
We have seen the entire Indian story. There was nothing in the sense that in 87 and all, one of the reason I got into the stock market is that I wanted to be a banker actually because during my CA stint I worked with a lot of banks in the sense that I was a banking audit expert. So I had an ambition to actually become a banker. Just blue suit and site out, go there and have fun. But then there was no banking. It was all public sector and I didn't want to work in public sector and that's how I landed up in setting up this. So this journey has been very exciting and it's a funny thing. I mean there were 500 brokers when I started and we were sub brokers. Today none of them are there. None. They are all there but they are completely marginalized.

Speaker B (00:26:27 -- 00:26:29):
What do you think is a big reason for that?

Speaker A (00:26:29 -- 00:27:13):
Just the pace of change. And they were very respected, very good guys. They knew their job very well, but they just couldn't build the organization. They couldn't make changes in the way they approached the clients. They were actually in seller's market and the market became buyer's market. So that twist you had to do build organization, consolidation, technology compliances. So they just couldn't create that corporate. And I don't know what got into our head. We said we want to build corporate until 95 97 it was like a mom pop shops here. Two guys were running a few crows. We are making and we are very happy. We justified our parents that yes, we are making more. Money than anybody else is making sure but then it got into our head in 97 98 we want to create.

Speaker B (00:27:13 -- 00:27:24):
A corporate which Yadati what led to that crazy decision? Because that I think is where as you. Rightly said most entrepreneurs are fearful of like what does it take to build another 20 years of journey?

Speaker A (00:27:24 -- 00:27:31):
Maybe it is a reading or there was one gentleman called Mr. Matthias. He's no more, he was a good friend, he was in HR.

Speaker B (00:27:32 -- 00:27:32):
Okay.

Speaker A (00:27:32 -- 00:28:02):
HR coming from? I think HUL Brook bond. Then I think he was in East India Hotel or something. So this guy I used to meet and I used to enjoy talking to him and he would say he would give exams, I mean, ultimate is HUL and all. So I used to say how the hell you do this? That the guy is not there and yet the machine works very efficiently. That's what was a funny thing. And we were reading Fortune and Business Week so the readings came to help. And our formal education in charaka, looking.

Speaker B (00:28:02 -- 00:28:05):
At case studies and poster children that you can emulate.

Speaker A (00:28:06 -- 00:28:18):
Yeah, so the ambition grew and we said why don't we have large company which outlast us, will be there for 30, 35 years, but can we create something which will be good for 100, 200, 500 years?

Speaker B (00:28:18 -- 00:28:36):
Fantastic to hear. I'm glad of course, that path played out for you and we have Motilal Oswal as a result. And when you talk to your children or the youngsters today, how do you talk about investing? Is there a new outlook or are the fundamentals identical to where it was 35 years ago?

Speaker A (00:28:36 -- 00:29:50):
Identical, but it's very competitive. Yeah, I mean, I have seen much cheaper markets, almost half the price. So for me my age is disadvantaged, my experience is a plus but my past experiences of seeing the markets much cheaper is a disadvantage because I'm not willing to pay those current prices asked for for a brilliant company. Also understood that's how it is. But I think there's so much of information so it has become very competitive. Earlier, getting balance sheet was difficult. So I'm telling you, in 85, 87 our job was to read balance sheet and tell the guys who are sitting broking office buy this, this is good. You see this? This is good like that today, my God, you have PPT, you have audited, con, call script, you have the quarterlies and you have so much of stuff available about the company and then you have CNBC, you have social media. So I think it has become very competitive and even managements have become very open. Corporate access is very good. So I think now the frameworks are very important. What will play out is not the information age. You don't have information advantage. Correct. We had clear information advantage. That's right. Institutional maybe 5% rest all was all retail. Correct. Today they are majority.

Speaker B (00:29:50 -- 00:29:51):
That's right.

Speaker A (00:29:51 -- 00:29:53):
And they are very well fed by the management.

Speaker B (00:29:53 -- 00:29:53):
That's right.

Speaker A (00:29:54 -- 00:30:19):
And they have the power of analysis, fund managers, analysts. Correct. It's now two things framework and hard work. So the guys who have framework, they only should do hard work. If you do only hard work, I don't think it's going to work. So if you are lucky to have a good framework of investing so that's 1% 99% still is hard work, but the journey starts with that 1%. That's what I think to a young.

Speaker B (00:30:19 -- 00:30:25):
Investor you would say pick an area that you really have an advantage on framework.

Speaker A (00:30:25 -- 00:30:44):
See, investing is very simple in a way that you have to understand. Price is what you pay, value is what you get. This is one of the most famous quote of Buffett. In fact, he sells it at $25. I have one up there. Basically the game is that price everybody knows value nobody knows.

Speaker B (00:30:44 -- 00:30:46):
That's a gem of coating, right?

Speaker A (00:30:46 -- 00:31:02):
And understanding value. The data is same data is available to everybody. But the framework to figure out the value of the company, that is approximately nobody wants to go through that. And once you have that framework of understanding value of any company, then the game is easy.

Speaker B (00:31:02 -- 00:31:07):
And on India, to wrap this section up, the two things, the positive side.

Speaker A (00:31:07 -- 00:31:09):
You'Ve talked about, we can look forward.

Speaker B (00:31:09 -- 00:31:11):
To another 25 years of compounded future.

Speaker A (00:31:11 -- 00:31:11):
Yeah.

Speaker B (00:31:12 -- 00:31:24):
And of course there's all sorts of macroeconomic data pointing towards that. Specifically, what do you think are like two, three insights that have convinced you that this is not public data? We all have public data.

Speaker A (00:31:25 -- 00:32:42):
See, the power of compounding at nation level, power of compounding is like huge. The whole machine is like compounding machine. There are very few countries like very few enterprises. They scale up like that. Very few countries also scale mean large countries. There are failures. You look at your neighbors, we started same day today where they are and where we have reached. And despite all the handicaps fighting this that India is one country which has in last 75 years survived and grown to become now 10% below porn. Correct. So now say you have done, say three and a half trillion or GDP it took 75 years to come to three and a half trillion. It will take just I would think about eight years to reach 7 trillion. Double from here, double from here. I mean, all our startups and everybody are going to play in this next from three and a half to seven journey. Now, what happens is that when you are at per capita GDP of say $1,000 of that 900 is essentials discretionaries, only $100. When you go from thousand to 2000, your essentials remain at thousand and your discretion is go to thousand. So what is the doubling of GDP is ten x for the discretionaries. So where do you play in that discussion?

Speaker B (00:32:43 -- 00:32:46):
It could be a bigger house, it could be a car, anything and we.

Speaker A (00:32:46 -- 00:33:37):
Can see it around. I mean, what has happened in China, Indonesia, Thailand, like emerging markets. So the business connect with that is going to be staggering and it is bound to happen if not seven years, eight years? One advice is that like buffett's one of the thing is always is that whenever bad time is there they said don't bet against America. I'm telling you, don't bet against India. India's story is compounded in the past and it is going to remain even more excitingly compounded in the future. We are all said 2030, 40, 50 years. So India's story is good for next 75 years and I think in that everybody today who is anything will be engulfed. So I think it's an amazing story and bring your best of the entrepreneurship and take out whatever you can. Well put sir.

Speaker B (00:33:37 -- 00:33:49):
And specifically either at an India level or at what you've built such a large business. Is there anything on the negative side that keeps you awake once in a while? Like what do you worry about if.

Speaker A (00:33:49 -- 00:33:51):
At all or is it what should.

Speaker B (00:33:51 -- 00:33:52):
We look out for and what should.

Speaker A (00:33:52 -- 00:34:54):
We be cautious know those kind of geopolitical things. Something happens like we are going through Ukraine it is going to create more problems than actually solving problems in India. Unfortunately, not only your future is uncertain, your past is also uncertain. So you get some tax notice or something which is if it is small then it's fine. But by chance it is such a big bomb because we are running one of the largest network of retail broking with some five 6000 points. All over the country 96% of Pin code is being touched by us. So what they are doing, I don't know. So what happens is that I'm most worried about my reputation because it's a financial sector, trust is very important. We are handling people's hardened savings day in day out. So they should not lose trust, they should not doubt my integrity, they doubt my competence. That's fine. When we commit mistake, obviously we're not competent to do that take that decision and we took that decision with good faith. So that worries me, the repetitional part of it.

Speaker B (00:34:54 -- 00:35:21):
So now we can move to the theme that I wanted to touch on compounding and maybe there it would be wonderful to hear any stories that come to your mind to be able to sort of communicate what it means to simply talk about it versus actually seeing it. Can people relate to brands and entrepreneurs that they've seen out there who've actually survived that? So one the first part of the question is you talked about price value, I get that.

Speaker A (00:35:21 -- 00:35:24):
But can you actually pick a great.

Speaker B (00:35:24 -- 00:35:38):
Entrepreneur or a great stock when you are actually looking at it for the first time thinking this is a compounder in the sense that Bispachesal Banega or Jobi who are Pedipan satsal I know this is going to be an immense.

Speaker A (00:35:38 -- 00:35:41):
Wealth creator and ulta B.

Speaker B (00:35:41 -- 00:35:49):
So I would love to hear a positive story and a false positive story. So why do they go wrong and has that happened in your case, investing.

Speaker A (00:35:49 -- 00:40:00):
One is always looking for a moonshot. But I always try to do double my money whenever I appraise anything. And I get excited about it. I know I'm very excited about it, but I know I might be wrong. But so long as my framework QGLP gives me points to a doubler in next three years and beyond that also doubling continues like ten X double in three years. Three X in five years and ten X in ten years. Correct. That kind of 25% compounded possibilities visible to me. That longevity, growth, trajectory and things like that, then I want to buy. Understood. But what happens if the real life is not like that? Correct. It's also choppy. What happens is that, see in investing, how much ahead you are to the crowd, what story you're telling me, whether a story is known to everybody. And that's where the understanding part comes. When I work for three days, day in, day out, all the data runs, forget it. But the entrepreneur is sitting in front of me, or the company is sitting in front. I don't like to do it at my office. I want to sit in their office because I want to just feel the air, the buzz, at what pace they want to do it. I have a good feel of what the business could do. It has happened in other parts of the world. So we have the large opportunity, but business still small. See, this is a market where you can buy $10 thing for one and you can sell one for ten. You got to know the value, whether ten is a hubba for one or not. Otherwise you'll always keep getting Rs1 stuff for $10 first. I think that was in 96, 97 in US. I was there first or second time I had gone to US and I went to visit one of the friends in one broking office. I was waiting and when our guys not come and somebody came and he flipped that phone with that antenna at that time, and he called somebody and one beautiful girl came and he went away. I said, what is this damn thing? I never heard about this. So he said, this is called cellular phone. That was in 90, maybe early 90s or 94. Early 90s, yeah. And then I read a paper on network businesses that was in 97, 98 or something. So I read about that and I said, this is one business. Telecom is one business. But we had only BSNL MTNL. Correct. Then in 2002. So I had the framework in my head and then Bharti Etel came out with public issue at $45 promptly they were making losses, so people got it issued and then they hammered it down to $18. Okay? So some of the guys were telling us, you guys don't understand. To us they were saying, you guys don't know what this seller fund can do. I said, you guys don't understand how the stock market works. I was so primitive to us in 2003 that if you're not making profit, no valuation correct. It came down to as low as $20 means 4000 crores. You could buy entire Bharti Airtel for 4000 crores entire 100%. So then in 23rd March I had done my numbers 23rd January 2003 there was a company called and they said we have broken even. I did my numbers in next five years as per me, this company was to make 28,000 crores and stock was around 4000 crores. What do you do? So what happened? I bought at 23.75. By the time it was $30 I was made to sell about 80% of my position. Everybody said that this is not like your type of stock. It's very risky. I sold then at 33 I said you guys don't understand what the hell is this? I bought ten X, stock went to 90. My analyst went to the Reliance and from there he called up as a good wisher sir, they'll crush this company. I sold half, stock went to 140. I again went five x. From there stock went to 1180. This is just three years journey. Go and see the chart. Then happened the scam and whole lot of it and then kind of reset. Then we sold and I was in.

Speaker B (00:40:00 -- 00:40:11):
Fact going to ask you when there's a false negative which is what happened here then do you buy back? Do you correct that mistake in the public markets? That advantage you have you can keep correcting this mistake.

Speaker A (00:40:11 -- 00:40:21):
But what I'm saying is that now this is a much bigger economy now it is three and a half trillion dollar economy. That's right. When we started it was maybe 100 billion dollar economy. In 2003 it might have been 200.

Speaker B (00:40:22 -- 00:40:23):
$300 billion, 200, 300 billion.

Speaker A (00:40:23 -- 00:40:41):
Now you are talking your playground is three and a half going to seven. Any good startup will just explode. I'm telling because in US why it explodes because it's a $25 trillion economy and they don't care to only 25 trillion. They carry to 100 trillion of the global economy because you sell elsewhere.

Speaker B (00:40:41 -- 00:40:43):
Yeah, they built a phenomenal global brand.

Speaker A (00:40:43 -- 00:40:58):
You need only a successful idea in US and it will be just multiplier. Now, that kind of phenomenon will happen in India because we'll not only build for India which is going to be 7 trillion but we'll also be building some global companies. Well said, sir.

Speaker B (00:40:58 -- 00:41:10):
That's kind of been a thesis. First examples are playing out and we're going to see a lot more. We saw it in It services but we'll see it in a lot more segments and Ulta like one mistake example of what you might have read wrong.

Speaker A (00:41:11 -- 00:41:49):
Magic happens in the businesses because of two things management sorry, business tellwind and management talent. So business we can analyze because it's all number and seeing example here there talking to people buyer seller trade terms. We are good in that. But at times you fail in understanding the guys of whose particularly there is not much known to the public or you are very excited about the concept despite somebody saying in fact, real sad thing is that despite people cautioning me, I went against their advice. I said business so good even if this guy little compromise will go through and then it hits you.

Speaker B (00:41:49 -- 00:41:50):
Does it happen already?

Speaker A (00:41:50 -- 00:42:01):
Yeah, does it happen? So never go with the crooks. I mean, if you don't know, that's fine. But if you know that this guy is a crook, never he will go to the hell and they will take everybody else also.

Speaker B (00:42:01 -- 00:42:14):
So the other thing about compounding, and I know you've touched upon it, but it's easier said than done. You make a decision in your mind as an entrepreneur, long term institution, banana.

Speaker A (00:42:14 -- 00:42:17):
And it should outlast me.

Speaker B (00:42:17 -- 00:42:18):
Very noble thought.

Speaker A (00:42:18 -- 00:42:19):
It's not easy.

Speaker B (00:42:19 -- 00:42:41):
The business has to be sustainable. It has to actually continue to grow, as you said, into the new economy. But that's the appeal of compounding, right? That growing from three and a half trillion to 7 trillion. You can build ten X, the company. How do you get an organization to think that way? Because it's a very different organization from the one you might have built before you running mom and pop at.

Speaker A (00:42:41 -- 00:43:55):
Yeah. So good thing is that when you are very small, you're on the ground floor, the scene is very different. When you become say billion dollar company, then view is very different. I can tell you this. You have your net worth, you have networks, you have a lot of senior employees, talented employees. There are a pool of talent. So you have a lot of help. It's not that you are as helpless as when you started. And so don't bother about how to build when you are at a $10 billion, don't bother about how do I go from a billion to 2 billion? Don't bother. That's not your subject. That's for the 10th guys. You are in the first tender. So I know running those billion dollar, trillion dollar company, it will be far more complicated, but it is much easier to manage those companies than the small ones. So we have to create competencies to manage what we have in hand. And our competency to create competition is limited. And that's why we are where we are. And the guys who have reached wherever they are, their competencies to create huge competencies or unlimited competencies is very high. But I think if your ambition is right, your value system is right, you're determined to walk the path. I think it will happen.

Speaker B (00:43:55 -- 00:44:18):
Any contrarian advice like all well laid out principles, but is there something unique that you or Motilalji have come up where you don't necessarily find consensus in the market? K as a Karnachaye, but a company, acha company, banana Kili. And then you actually said no, I've built it this way. Just curious if there are any traits of a Motilal Oswal that are unique to you?

Speaker A (00:44:23 -- 00:44:30):
They say 98, 97 maybe. Nothing like Docha Kroger revenue profit raga.

Speaker B (00:44:35 -- 00:44:37):
The brand wasn't very well known, not at all.

Speaker A (00:44:37 -- 00:44:58):
Nobody was aware. So we hired a marketing manager, he started giving us lessons and myself and Moti, we used to sit half day with him once or twice in a week. How to learn? Yeah, you have to learn. We didn't know marketing. Whole lot of books we read, but we didn't know how to do it ourselves. This guy, Jagdeep Kapoor from Samsika, he.

Speaker B (00:44:58 -- 00:45:01):
Helped, he was very popular in Bombay.

Speaker A (00:45:01 -- 00:45:04):
We were one of the early clients, very early clients of his.

Speaker B (00:45:04 -- 00:45:07):
He must have used you as a case study for decades.

Speaker A (00:45:07 -- 00:45:09):
I don't know. But he's a lovely guy.

Speaker B (00:45:09 -- 00:45:11):
There is a lovely guy, I bet him all.

Speaker A (00:45:11 -- 00:45:34):
So we started writing well creation thoughts of Buffets in economic times and how big? One inch by one column or two inch by one column, something like that. So you had to fix so he said you got to have poisoning. What is poisoning? He said you got to be somebody should call you what? I said we are stockbrokers. So I said we are research based stockbrokers. So he said world class research broker.

Speaker B (00:45:34 -- 00:45:36):
Lovely, lovely to hear these.

Speaker A (00:45:36 -- 00:46:08):
So we used to write world class research broker Motila Swal in the wealth creation thought and I used to fit the entire quote of Buffett in 13 words. I used to do pressy. So every Monday morning, the front page one in fact that column was started by us just below that index and all we will buy two or three inches and put that so that's how you have to build. Now you see all our airports and CNBC, but that's the magnified version of what we started that time. Great story.

Speaker B (00:46:08 -- 00:46:12):
So one parting sort of question.

Speaker A (00:46:12 -- 00:46:14):
I think we're at a cusp of.

Speaker B (00:46:14 -- 00:47:11):
Trying to educate the startup ecosystem on how to build these compounded long term stories and we're trying to at least at bloom's level. And now I think most of the industry is following suit. It's not like our bazaar Mejaki, you can exit like bazaar Mehlab. Literally, you go to a window and there's a counter open for quote unquote exit. Everybody has invested time, money with the idea of getting returns back. And therefore if you don't go to the public markets or think of that as the most obvious exit and if you don't build compounded stories beyond that because nobody wants a public company which gets sold the next morning. So they want the promise of Daspandra Sal Bisal curaya company. So everyone's asking those tough questions and did your life change post going public? You've seen hundreds of public companies. Why are young entrepreneurs so scared of going public? And what's your advice to them? What changes and why should they be worried or not?

Speaker A (00:47:11 -- 00:48:45):
They must understand what is stock market? Stock market is compounding and discounting machine, whatever you do. So it's a very simple place. So you get liquidity to your stocks. But see, the very fact that you are an entrepreneur and see the purpose of entrepreneurship should not be getting listed and getting valuation and those quotes and all that's correct. That I'm very clear about it. Okay, so now you are successful and you have done some journey. Say you have created 100 crore company, 100 crore turnover and say 1015 crores profit. Wonderful. With Roe of 20 30%. The good thing is that today there are enough buyers and they are willing to pay premium for these companies in unlisted space. So they should not unnecessarily harp on going public. If they're very tiny, if your patience is over or your investor's patience is over, let them sell it to another investor as a priority guy who will take to the next round. When the companies have matured, I'm in the sense that they have gone from say 100 crores, 1000 crores or today 2000 crores and 200 cross profits. Now you're ready for facing the market. Because once you become micro cap then no institutional money is going to chase you. That's also true. Then you say Sir, Mera Company kawakado Mera Company cover. Why do all this hassle you're a successful entrepreneur. You're already making 50 crores, ten crores, whatever. You're not slave of anybody. Just grow. You have fun. You just keep building your company. In five years time you'll be through with that. So I would think that stock market is just an incidental to anybody's successful journey in the corporate world. You don't have to prepone that.

Speaker B (00:48:45 -- 00:48:55):
No. Thanks for compounding my advice. So we give this advice to our founders, good number of them. Take it now. I'm waiting for this decade to play out all that hard.

Speaker A (00:48:55 -- 00:48:57):
You also talk to other guys.

Speaker B (00:48:57 -- 00:49:36):
That's true. So that's why I'm using the words of wisdom from Mr. Agarwal today to sort of, as I said, compound the message. Once again, this was fantastic. As always, I enjoyed that first conversation we had many months ago and I would love for you to be talking to more of our audiences and our stakeholders. And hopefully hundreds or thousands of entrepreneurs are going to listen to this and understand that even Amotilal Oswal was a startup and it went through the same journey. It went from a mom and pop to a large corporate and became a national brand. And you're still excited about compounding.

Speaker A (00:49:36 -- 00:49:38):
You're still a startup. I'm telling you.

Speaker B (00:49:38 -- 00:49:48):
That's fantastic to hear. Thank you for a wonderful and inspirational chat today and I hope our listeners enjoy this episode and we thoroughly enjoyed it. So thank you once again.
